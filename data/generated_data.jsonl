Observational comedy like Seinfeld and John Mulaney often focuses on the mundane and the relatable. Considering the setting of both NYC and LA, public transportation is a great angle - it's relatable, frustrating, and full of characters. The idea of \"missing\" someone on public transportation, both physically and metaphorically, could be rich. Let's explore the concept of seeing someone attractive on public transit, the fleeting nature of the encounter, and the longing that follows. This could lead to a series of observations about the human condition, technology's role in our lives, and the absurdity of modern dating. To make it PG-13 and ensure it works in both cities, focusing on the universal feelings of connection and disconnection could be key.

Not just any person, but the kind of person where you're like, \"Wow, they're reading a real book, not just staring at their phone like a zombie.\" And I'm thinking, \"This could be it. This could be the start of something beautiful.\" But, of course, because this is real life and not a romantic comedy, the doors close, and they're gone. Just like that. It's like the universe is playing this cruel joke on us, bringing us close to someone, just to rip them away. And then you're left standing there, wondering, \"Did I just imagine the whole thing? Was it real?\" It's like we're all just ships passing in the night, or rather, trains passing in the tunnel. But here's the thing: in a city of millions, the chances of running into that person again are slim to none. It's like finding a needle in a haystack, or in our case, finding a decent apartment in NYC or LA without having to sell your soul. So, what do we do? We turn to technology, of course. We post about it on social media, hoping against hope that this mystery person will see it and reach out. \"Hey, were you on the 4 train at 3 PM yesterday? I think we had a moment.\" It sounds ridiculous, but we've all been there. The desperation, the longing, it's all just part of the human experience. And then, just when you think it's all over, you see them again. Maybe it's on the bus, maybe it's at a coffee shop, but it happens. And you're like, \"This is it. This is fate.\" But, as it often does, fate has other plans. They're on their way to meet someone else, or they're just not interested. It's like the universe is playing this never-ending game of tease and denial. But we keep playing, don't we? We keep hoping, keep searching, because that's what we do. We're humans, and this is modern dating. It's a game of missed connections, fleeting moments, and the perpetual search for something real in a world that seems more and more artificial by the day. And if you're lucky, just lucky, you might find that person again. Or, at the very least, you'll have a good story to tell. Either way, it's a reminder that even in a city of millions, connection is possible.
